# A nice button that promises to call you back.

It takes your callback(s), wraps them in promises using the $q library, 
and then nicely disables and enables the button while changing the labels for you.

[See a demo here: http://willoller.github.io/cool-button-bro/](http://willoller.github.io/cool-button-bro/ "Demo")

Cool button, bro.
